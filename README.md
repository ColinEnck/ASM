# ASM

Come join me in my adventures in learning how to program in Assembly,
writing in x86 32-bit Assembly with the Intel syntax
This is going to be written from a Linux machine with the GNU Assembler
and GCC; I was told that *as* only used AT&T syntax but I was pleasantly
surprised.

The makefile will compile any .asm file that is named *main.asm*
